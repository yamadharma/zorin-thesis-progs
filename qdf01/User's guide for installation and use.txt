i) Installation of the Maple libary for the QDF01 package
---------------------------------------------------------

To install the QDF01 package, it is sufficient to make the following
step:

(a) Open the file QDF01_install_lib and execute it. The library SourceFunctions_Sturm
    will be then available by the command

	with(SourceFunctions_Sturm)

    in any Maple worksheet opened in this computer.


ii)  Use of the package
-------------------------------

(a) The file QDF01_source is the main file which represents the full version of the package.
    It is constructed as a short manual for users and contains extensive comments, examples and
    explanations. It may be used for calculations as well.

(b) The file QDF01_work is a short version of the QDF01_source and does not contain extensive
    explanations and examples. It is recommended for calculations.
 

(c) Please, note that the data files (B_E0, inv_B_E0, OHM_1, OHM_2, OHM_3, OHM_4, lev_Li, lev_Na)
    should be located in the same directory as the used Maple worksheet.

(d) Calculations of Ritz matrices may be skipped in case that they have been calculated before.
    The matrices for hydrogen-like atoms may be read from external files (B_E0, inv_B_E0, OHM_1, 
    OHM_2, OHM_3, OHM_4). In case that you have made modifications in auxiliary functions and/or
    potential energy or any other changes that  affected the calculation of Ritz matrices, you 
    should calculate these matrices using the present program.

(e) The files lev_Li, lev_Na contain experimental excited energy levels of neutral Li and Na atoms 
    retrieved from  NIST Atomic Spectra Database Levels Data  -  
    http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/index.html. This data is read and used by the program.
